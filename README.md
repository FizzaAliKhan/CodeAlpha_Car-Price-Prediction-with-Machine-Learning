# CodeAlpha_Car-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning in Python involves building a predictive model to estimate the price of a car based on various factors such as brand reputation, horsepower, engine size, mileage, age of the car, and more. The key steps in the project are:

1. Data Collection: Collect or generate a dataset with features like car specifications (e.g., horsepower, mileage) and their corresponding prices.
   
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and convert categorical data (like car type or brand) into a numerical format.

3. Model Selection: Choose regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict the price.

4. Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, then train the model on the training data.

5. Prediction & Evaluation: Use the trained model to predict car prices and evaluate its accuracy using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

This project helps in understanding how different car features influence pricing and how machine learning can be applied to predict complex outcomes like car prices.
